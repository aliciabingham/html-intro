# HTML Introduction

## Description
Our first introduction to HTML. On our first night of class, after running our terminals and downloading the necessary programs, we worked through the HTML tags.

## How to run
In your terminal, run:
```
http-server -p 4040
```
then navigate to http://127.0.0.1:4040 in your browser.
